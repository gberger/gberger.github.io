<p>
	I'm a Computer Engineering student at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/>">PUC-Rio</a>,
	and I'm currently studying Computer Science abroad at the <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/">UNC at Chapel Hill</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I have experience in web development, both front-end and back-end.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the time I babbling on for uncomfortable amounts of time about
	hacking, open source software development, and science (!).
