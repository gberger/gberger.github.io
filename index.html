<p>
	I'm a Computer Engineering student at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/>">PUC-Rio</a>,
	and I'm currently studying Computer Science abroad at the <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/">UNC at Chapel Hill</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I have experience in web development, both front-end and back-end. I'm comfortable with modern front-end
	tools such as CoffeeScript, Sass, LESS and Grunt, and like using either Ruby or NodeJS on the back-end,
	with or without frameworks such as Rails or Express.
</p>
<p>
	Overall, my philosophy is aligned with building systems composed of smaller units that can be tested
	and developed independently.
</p>
<p>
	You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/gberger">Github</a> or
	<a href="http://facebook.com/gberger">Facebook</a>.
	You can also drop a line at guilherme.berger@gmail.com.
