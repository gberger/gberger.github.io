Among the many products sold at the [Github Store](http://shop.github.com/){:target="_blank"},
the [Octodex Sticker Packs](http://shop.github.com/products/octodex-sticker-pack){:target="_blank"}
 re probably some of the most popular items. Each pack contains 10 different
 Octocat](http://octodex.github.com/){:target="_blank"} stickers and costs $5. If you're a lover of
 the mascot (who isn't?), you'd probably be inclined to buy a pack or three.

I purchased 3 packs a couple weeks ago, for a total of $15 plus $5 to account for shipping to
Brazil. When the package arrived, I noticed the USPS label said the shipping cost $35.65.
I was intrigued by this: did Github really lose $15.65 on this sale?

I enquired about the situation by email and got this response from Amber:

> It does cost us quite a bit to ship internationally, so that price you saw
is probably what we had to pay to ship your package. Glad to hear your stickers
arrived though!

It seems Github is willing to lose a few dollars on each sale in exchange for being able
to expand their branding to countries like Brazil.

As for the stickers, I'm very satisfied with their print quality and overall awesomeness.
I've already glued some to my laptop and gave some others to friends.
