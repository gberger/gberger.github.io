As a student of Computer Engineering, I am taking part in a Brazilian
government program called [CiÃªncia Sem Fronteiras](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf)
("Science Without Borders"). This means that I'm going to be given a scholarship to study in the U.S. for one year.

Details aside, this leads up to last week, when me and other 15,000
participating students were awaiting for their so-called "Term Of Appointment"
(TOA) to arrive, a document that informs us which will be our host school in
the U.S. This document is distrubuted on seemingly random batches and without
any notice: you need to log into the system to check if yours is already there.

Obviously, this leads to lots of people freaking out about when they'll finally receive their TOA.

**As a developer, I have the mindset that I have the skills to change the world
around me for the benefit of me and other people.** When  I am having a problem that
I know I can solve and that I know other people are having too, this is an opportunity for a developer solution.

So I set off to create a bot that would check whether my TOA had arrived and,
if so, alert me by email. I allowed fellow CSFers to subscribe to email notifications
about their own documents.

People could sign up on http://toansioso.herokuapp.com/ and
[the source code is published on Github](https://github.com/gberger/toa).

The initiative was well-received by my peers, leading to hundreds of visits to
 the webpage and 80+ registrations for the service.

The takeaway from this is that being a hacker in today's world is a highly valuable
 everyday skill. It can facilitate repetitive or boring tasks that come up so frequently
  on the routine of a computer user.

**Update**: Zach Holman has a [great writeup](http://zachholman.com/2010/10/facelette-on-techcrunch-in-three-hours-and-zero-dollars/)
on this:

> We're in the most ridiculous industry on earth. You can whip something up in a
few hours and before you know it, people around the world will be using it. That is insane.
An architect or a fireman or a lawyer or anyone else can't say that for their profession or their hobby.
